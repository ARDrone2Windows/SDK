### Thanks!!!
This SDK would have never been there without the passion of some valuable guys. We started the development of this SDK reusing most of patterns introduced by [Ruslan Balanukhin]( https://github.com/Ruslan-B) in the great [AR.Drone projet for C# and Mono](https://github.com/Ruslan-B/AR.Drone). Some other great ideas, introduced by [alex100990](http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/alex100990) and his team in the [Windows Phone AR.Drone controller]( http://wp7ardrone.codeplex.com/) have been partially reused. Finally thanks to [TechPreacher](https://github.com/TechPreacher) who has shared a nice [Joystick control] (https://github.com/TechPreacher/WP8-Joystick-UserControl), we reused on improved in our code.
At your turn, feel free to download this SDK, extend, test, send feedback and finally share!

### Issues or Feedback?
Despite our efforts to propose to the community a well-polished SDK, we apologize if you won’t get the best experience from our work. Please [log any bug or improvement request](https://github.com/ARDrone2Windows/SDK/issues/new) that may help us to improve the quality of the solution. We will update both the SDK and its [documentation](https://github.com/ARDrone2Windows/SDK/wiki) from your feedback. We don’t have the pretention neither to release a zero bug solution, nor to cover all the features supported by the AR.Drone 2.0. 
This SDK shared “As Is” is composed of one Windows Phone 8 and one Windows 8 library that share 95% of their code. Those libraries deal with command, navigation data and configuration management. A separate library is specialized on the video stream decoding. We also provide two samples apps (one for Windows 8 and one for Windows Phone 8) to demonstrate the usage of our SDK.

Enjoy the experience!
