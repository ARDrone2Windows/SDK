You will find in this place all the materials let to your disposal, to participate to the Windows Phone 8 / Windows 8 app contest for the famous AR.Drone 2.0 from Parrot. Before any action if you are motivated to participate to this contest, send us your idea of application (before July 21 23h59 Paris time), we will contact you soon:
-  If you are from France email us at Ardrone2windows@microsoft.com

Notice the SDK usage is not limited to the only contest participants. Feel free to download, test, develop and send feedback!
You will be able to download our SDK in the upcoming hours.

Despite our efforts to propose to the community a well-polished SDK, we apologize if you won’t get the best experience from our work. Please log any bug or improvement request that may help us to improve the quality of the solution. We will update both the SDK and its documentation from your feedback. We don’t have the pretention neither to release a zero bug solution, nor to cover all the features supported by the AR.Drone 2.0. 
This SDK shared “As Is” is composed of one Windows Phone 8 and one Windows 8 library that share 95% of their code. Those libraries deal with command, navigation data and configuration management. A separate library is specialized on the video stream decoding. We also provide two samples apps (one for Windows 8 and one for Windows Phone 8) to demonstrate the usage of our SDK.

Enjoy the experience!
