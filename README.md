Notice the SDK usage is not limited to the only contest participants. Feel free to download, test, develop and send feedback!

### Availability
You will be able to download our SDK in the upcoming hours.

Despite our efforts to propose to the community a well-polished SDK, we apologize if you won’t get the best experience from our work. Please [log any bug or improvement request](https://github.com/ARDrone2Windows/SDK/issues/new) that may help us to improve the quality of the solution. We will update both the SDK and its [documentation](https://github.com/ARDrone2Windows/SDK/wiki) from your feedback. We don’t have the pretention neither to release a zero bug solution, nor to cover all the features supported by the AR.Drone 2.0. 
This SDK shared “As Is” is composed of one Windows Phone 8 and one Windows 8 library that share 95% of their code. Those libraries deal with command, navigation data and configuration management. A separate library is specialized on the video stream decoding. We also provide two samples apps (one for Windows 8 and one for Windows Phone 8) to demonstrate the usage of our SDK.

Enjoy the experience!
